  <h1>Writing Assignment One</h1>
  <p>A well-designed software that I have used is Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio.  
    This is due it being easy to use while either directly having capabilities or the ability to use extensions or other 
    means to do anything you need to do with it.  Proper software design is important for many reasons.  It increases the 
    speed of development and reduces errors by making code readable and easy to understand.  It can help prevent errors 
    and compromises that will cause the end user to have to fight with the program instead of just using it.  This 
    worsens the user experience, leading to poor reviews, less previous users coming back, less new customers, and less 
    money for developer.  In short, proper software design will allow you to produce better programs faster, 
    have more and happier users, and more money if you are selling your program. </p>

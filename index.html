  <h1>Writing Assignment One</h1>
  <p>A well-designed software that I have used is Microsoft’s Visual Studio.  
    This is due it being easy to use while either directly having capabilities or the ability to use extensions or other 
    means to do anything you need to do with it.  Proper software design is important for many reasons.  It increases the 
    speed of development and reduces errors by making code readable and easy to understand.  It can help prevent errors 
    and compromises that will cause the end user to have to fight with the program instead of just using it.  This 
    worsens the user experience, leading to poor reviews, less previous users coming back, less new customers, and less 
    money for developer.  In short, proper software design will allow you to produce better programs faster, 
    have more and happier users, and more money if you are selling your program. </p>

  <h1>Writing Assignment Two</h1>
  <p>The requirement’s gathering stage is important as it tells you what your client wants for the project.  
    Preforming the requirements gathering stage properly allows you to understand what the client wants, plan out what needs
    to be done and allows you to tell the client if they are asking for too much.  
    Not preforming this step leads to you potentially repeating all the other steps and can increase the time it takes to 
    preform all the following steps in the process.  For example, not preforming this step can cause the client to keep 
    asking for more features, leading to convoluted design of the software,
    increasing the time it takes to develop the software and making it a nightmare for new people to work on and maintain.</p>

<p>As a user, I want the ability to run terminal commands inside the system, so I can use other parts of the computer without leaving the system.</p>

<p>As a user, I want the ability to use extensions to add additional features, so I can use features developed by other users.</p>

<p>As a user, I want the ability to use any programming language, so I can use the system to develop any other systems.</p>

<p>As a user, I want the ability to have easily switch the file I am working on, so large multifile programs become faster to write.</p>

<p>As a user, I want the system to flag syntax errors, so  I can find errors and bugs in my programs faster.</p>

  <h1>Writing Assignment Four(Where did three go nobody knows)</h1>
  <p>Communication is important for software design as the process nearly always requires more than one person, 
    and communication is the process that ensures they are both working based on the same information.  
    Three of the key elements needed for communication are being honest, as incorrect information leads to incorrect 
    results, being able to listen as if someone tells you something and you do not listen, what ever they said 
    is useless to you, and being fair, as if someone messes up and your too harsh on them, they may either panic or
    not listen to you.  I have not listened to someone properly on some math projects a while back,
    which resulted in me not knowing a shortcut on how to do things so the project took five times longer.</p>
